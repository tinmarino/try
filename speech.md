# 1/ Intro: MJ 30s

Good morning,

We work in the Alma Department of Computing.
We all live among computers as users on daily life.
The difference in the Computing group is that we never leave them.

As for cooking, coding is a metaphor of labour, transformation, life!
Code is the ingredient that enable us to repair the system
Welcome to this digital world!

There is only one rule: software never works.
We, humble humans, never know how to fix it but anyway,
we are going to show you how we try!

# 2/ Hot and Cold: Dichotomy: Tin 1min


## Description

There is a game called: "hot and cold", do you know it?
The goal is to find a hidden object.

At any moment, the player can query if he his getting closer, hotter or further, colder from that hidden target.

This investigation method exhibits the entropically optimal way to store or find with respectively cartesian coordinates or binary trees.

When I play, I just spare my brain and instinctively, if nothing goes right, go left!

## Comparision

Astronomers call that walk "Fitting".
Computerists call it: "artificial intelligence".
Where going down the slope of weights of a "neuronal" network is referred as "Training".

Musicians say: "Tune",
  * Critics: "Tweak",
  * Cooks: "Taste",
  * Providers: "Check"
  * Clients: "Test"
  * and I "Try".

When business "Speculate", sport "Run for", and gigahertz machine "Fuzz";
like them, I analyse, stand still and have my shot!

Bang! MJ cover me!


# 3/ Humble Example: MJ 1min

Anyway, just do your best because that is the best you can do!
If you keep trying until success, you will succeed before you stop!

Once upon a time, in nothern Atacama a remote region of my native country 
an antenna called CM11 was not locking.
This was declared as a SW problem, our problem.
At that time band locking was an unknown problem.

We went all over and above the code, files, monitoring points, tiny details
trying to identify and discard probables scenarios of already known issues between HW and SW.
Ahhh ... HW and SW ... Those 2 ... such silly boys!

At some moment, we were 3 brains, 6 eyes trying to catch where all this was failling...
(tic tac) the clock marked bed time and in the lack of further hypotesis
we had to stop our investigation.

But that day I made a promise to this antenna, my robotic friend CM11, to never let it down.
And I still keep trying to fullfill this promise

# 4/ Enumeration: MJ 1min

## Descriptive

(
You may "know" that the resolution of Alma is limited by the longest baseline: the diffraction pattern of the synthetic aperture.
Do you believe in this quantum limit in the continuous realm?
Try to allow what is not explicitly forbidden.
)

## Q/A

MJ: We can try to publish a fruitless investigation ...
Ti: So that we can learn from our mistakes

Ti: Actualy let's try to promote failure ...
MJ: We cannot fail at that!

MJ: Let's try to practice and make perfect ...
Ti: Perfection is the unique objective quality metric

Ti: We can try to build trust
MJ: Trust is pillar of collaboration

---

MJ: We can try to connect and, if we want, we can try not to try.

# 5/ Conclusion: Tin 30s

Here in Alma, we work among astronomers within Galileo Galilei's legacy.

His heritage survives not only in astrophysics. It transcends science.
He taught us that natural science is not defined by some big equations and small drawings.
No more than social science is defined by a rich vocabulary and an empty pocket.
Both their essences lie in our attitude.

Here in Alma, within Galileo Galilei's legacy we work among astronomers.
Let's admire and try to imitate them!

Thank you for your attention.
