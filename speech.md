# 1/ Intro: MJ 30s

Good morning,

We work in the Alma Department of Computing.
Everyone uses computers for his daily duties.
The difference in Computing is that we never leave them.

As for cooking, coding is a metaphor of labour, transformation, life!
Welcome to this digital world!

There is only one rule: software never works.
We, humble humans, never know how to fix it but anyway,
we are going to show you how we try!


# 2/ Hot and Cold: Dichotomy: Tin 1min


## Description

There is a game called: "hot and cold" where the goal is to find a hidden object.

At any moment, the player can query if he his getting closer, hotter or further, colder from that hidden target.

This investigation method exhibits the entropically optimal way to store or find with respectively cartesian coordinates or binary trees.

When I play, I just spare my brain and instinctively, if nothing goes right, go left!

## Comparaison

Astronomers call that walk "Fitting".
Computerist call it: "artificial intelligence".
Where going down the slope of weights of a "neuronal" network is referred as "Training".

Musicians say: "Tune",
  * Critics: "Tweak",
  * Cooks: "Taste",
  * Providers: "Check"
  * Clients: "Test"
  * and I "Try".

When business "Speculate", sport "Run for", and gigahertz machine "Fuzz";
like them, I stand still, analyse, wait, and have my shot!

Bang! MJ cover me!


# 3/ Humble Example: MJ 1min

Anyway, just do your best because that is the best you can do!
If you keep trying until success, you will succeed before you stop!

CM11 not locking band scenario Declared as a SW problem, band locking issue was an unknown problem.

We went all over and above the code, files, monitoring points
trying to identify and/or discard other probable scenarios of known problemas between HW and SW.
At some moment, we were 6 eyes, 3 brains trying to catch where these was failling...

We are yet ignorants in terms of electronic devices but we collect and gather information to create the big picture during this troubleshooting
even when we go over and above, the lack of further points to discard or investigate... stopped our investigation

maybe tomorrow we are lucky enough to watch a similar case or scenario that help us connect the dots,
to create the bigger picture while troubleshooting.

# 4/ Enumeration: MJ 1min

## Descriptive

We are small things, we trust what we see.
Trust is pillar of collaboration, fundamental element of operational efficiency.
So try to show yourself!

You have the right to disobey, to do it your way, to think and exist!
Fear does not avoid danger!

You may "know" that the resolution of Alma is limited by the longer baseline: the diffraction pattern of the synthetic aperture.
Do you believe in this quantum limit in the continuous realm?
Try to allow what is not explicitly forbidden.

## Q/A

MJ: Let's try to publish a fruitless investigation ...
Ti: So that we can learn from our mistakes

Ti: We can try to promote failure ...
MJ: We cannot fail at that!

MJ: Let's try to practice and make perfect ...
Ti: Perfection is the unique objective quality metric


MJ: We can try to connect and, if we will, we can try not to try.


# 5/ Conclusion: Tin 30s

Here in Alma, we work among astronomers within Galileo Galilei's legacy.

His heritage survives not only in astrophysics. It transcends science.
He taught us than natural science is not defined by some big equations and small drawings.
No more than social science is defined by a rich vocabulary and an empty pocket.
Both their essences lie in our attitude.

Here in Alma, within Galileo Galilei's legacy we work among astronomers.
Let's admire and try to imitate them!

Thank you for your attention.
