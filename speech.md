## Intro (MJ 40s)

Good morning,
We are 2 lost souls working in the Alma Department of Computing.
Here, everyone uses computers for their daily duties but in computing we have no professional life outside the digital world!
As for cooking, fixing a binary machine is a pretty methafore of labour, transformation, life!
Welcome in this digital world!
Software never works, we never know what to do it,

TODO

If you keep trying until sucess, you will succeed before you stop

## 1/ Hot and Cold: Dichotomy (Tin 1min)

* Entropy




## 2/ Humble Example (MJ 1min)



## 3/ Enumeration (MJ 1min)

We are small things, we trust what we see.
Trust is pillar of collaboration, fundamental element of operational eficiency.
So try to show us your face! Don't worry, you won't loose it!

Take your place among the brave ones
It's time you stand, fight... discover... heal, love, win.

You may know (in quotes) that the resolution of Alma is limited by the difraction of the synthetic aperture, the longer baseline.
Do you believe in this limit ?

## Conclusion (Tin 40s)

* Try, Tune, Taste
Let's admire and imitate them!

Thank you for your attention.
