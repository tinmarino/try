## Intro: We: MJ 30s

Good morning,
We are 2 lost souls working in the Alma Department of Computing.
Here, everyone uses computers for their daily duties but in computing we have ~~no professional life outside the digital world!~~

As for cooking, coding is a methafore of labour, transformation, life!
Welcome in this digital world!
Softwares never work. We, humans, never know what to do it but will anyway show you how we try!


## 1/ Hot and Cold: I: Dichotomy: Tin 1min

There is a game called: "hot and cold" where the goal is to find an hidden object.
At any moment, the player can query if he his getting closer or futher from the goal.
This investigation method implements an entropycally optimal way to find or geolocalise with respectively a binary tree or cartesian coordinates.
At this game, I just turn off my brain and remember that if nothing goes right, go left!
Also that if I keep trying until sucess, I will succeed before I stop.

Astronomers call that walk "Fitting".
Computerist: "artificial inteligence" where going down the slope of weights of a "neuronal" network is reffered as "training".

Musicians say: "Tune", Criticss "Tweak", Cooks: "Taste", and I "Try".
When business "Speculate", sport "Run for", and gigahertz machine "Fuzz",
like them, I stand still, analyse, wait and have my shot! (Como shileno shoro shatumare => bang, oh shit ...)

MJ Cover me!

## 2/ Humble Example: I->You: MJ 1min

Oh dear, you need backup!


Anyway, just do your best because that is the best you can do!

## 3/ Enumeration: You->We: MJ 1min

We are small things, we trust what we see.
Trust is pillar of collaboration, fundamental element of operational eficiency.
So try to show us your face! Don't worry, you won't loose it!

You have the right to disobey, to do it your way, to think then exist!
Take your place among the brave ones.
~~It's time you stand, fight... discover... heal, love, win.~~

You may know (in quotes) that the resolution of Alma is limited by the difraction of the synthetic aperture, the longer baseline.
Do you believe in this quantum limit in the continus realm?

Let's admire and imitate them!

Thank you for your attention.
