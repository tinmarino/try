## 1/ Intro: We: MJ 30s

Good morning,
We are 2 lost souls working in the Alma Department of Computing.
Here, everyone uses computers for their daily duties but in computing we have ~~no professional life outside the digital world!~~

As for cooking, coding is a metaphor of labour, transformation, life!
Welcome in this digital world!
Software never work. We, humble humans, never know how to fix it but, anyway, we are going to show you how we try!


## 2/ Hot and Cold: I: Dichotomy: Tin 1min

There is a game called: "hot and cold" where the goal is to find an hidden object.

At any moment, the player can query if he his getting closer or further from the goal.

This investigation method exhibits the entropically optimal way to find or store with respectively a binary tree or Cartesian coordinates.

When I play, I just spare my brain and instinctively, if nothing goes right, go left!
As I keep trying until success, I succeed before I stop.

Astronomers call that walk "Fitting".
Computerist call it: "artificial intelligence".
Where going down the slope of weights of a "neuronal" network is referred as "Training".

Musicians say: "Tune", Critics: "Tweak", Cooks: "Taste", and I "Try".
When business "Speculate", sport "Run for", and gigahertz machine "Fuzz",
like them, I stand still, analyse, wait and have my shot! (Como shileno shoro shatumare => bang, oh shit ...)

MJ Cover me!


## 3/ Humble Example: I->You: MJ 1min

(Oh dear, you need backup!)

Anyway, just do your best because that is the best you can do!

### Example 1

CM11 not locking band scenario Declared as a SW problem, band locking issue was a unknown problem 
We went all over and above the code, input files, reviewing monitoring points
trying to identify and/or discard other probable scenarios of known problemas between HW and SW.
At some moment, we were 6 eyes, 3 brains trying to catch where these was failling... we are yet ignorants in
terms of electronic devices but we collect and gather information to create the big picture during this troubleshooting
even when we go over and above, the lack of further points to discard or investigate... stopped our investigation
maybe tomorrow we are lucky enough to watch a similar case or scenario that help us connect the dots, to create
the bigger picture while troubleshooting.


## 4/ Enumeration: You->We: MJ 1min

We are small things, we trust what we see.
Trust is pillar of collaboration, fundamental element of operational efficiency.
So try to show us your words your face! Don't worry, you won't loose it!

You have the right to disobey, to do it your way, to think then exist!
Fear does not avoid danger (neither does courage. But fear makes you weak, and courage makes you strong.)
Take your place among the brave ones.
~~It's time you stand, fight... discover... heal, love, win.~~

Where niceness is received as weakness, 

Try to report / publish a failed investigation.

You may "know" that the resolution of Alma is limited by the diffraction of the synthetic aperture, the longer baseline.
Do you believe in this quantum limit in the continuous realm?

(@MJ, I put more in README/Example)


## 5/ Conclusion: We: Tin 30s

Here in Alma, we work among astronomers within Galileo Galilei's legacy.

His heritage survives not only in astrophysics. It transcends science.
He taught us than natural science is not defined by some complicated equations and simple drawings.
No more than social science is defined by a rich vocabulary and an empty pocket.
Both their essences lie in our attitude.

Here in Alma, within Galileo Galilei's legacy we work among astronomers.
Let's admire (, troll) and try to imitate them!

Thank you for your attention.
