## Intro: We: MJ 30s

Good morning,
We are 2 lost souls working in the Alma Department of Computing.
Here, everyone uses computers for their daily duties but in computing we have ~~no professional life outside the digital world!~~

As for cooking, coding is a methafore of labour, transformation, life!
Welcome in this digital world!
Softwares never work. We, humans, never know what to do it but will anyway show you how we try!


## 1/ Hot and Cold: I: Dichotomy: Tin 1min

There is a game called: "hot and cold".

* Entropycally optimal (like binary cartesian coordinates)

Astronomers call that walk "fitting" (or best chi square fit).
Computerist call that "artificial inteligence" where going down the slope of weights in a network called neuronal is reffered as "training".

* Try, Tune, Taste
* Fuzz
* If nothing goes right, go left!
* If you keep trying until sucess, you will succeed before you stop (lesson from hitchhicking and today I am here)

## 2/ Humble Example: I->You: MJ 1min



## 3/ Enumeration: You->We: MJ 1min

We are small things, we trust what we see.
Trust is pillar of collaboration, fundamental element of operational eficiency.
So try to show us your face! Don't worry, you won't loose it!

You have the right to disobey, to do it your way, to think then exist!
Take your place among the brave ones.
~~It's time you stand, fight... discover... heal, love, win.~~

You may know (in quotes) that the resolution of Alma is limited by the difraction of the synthetic aperture, the longer baseline.
Do you believe in this quantum limit in the continus realm?

## Conclusion: We: Tin 30s

* Gallileo Gallilei

Let's admire and imitate them!

Thank you for your attention.
