# Old todo task for MJ

2/ (10min) Critic 4/Enumeration/Descriptive: I made 3 points, 1/trust, 2/fear 3/Curisotiry. I LOVE 2 and 3 but 1 => try to show us your face is not really good, just tell me what you feel
3/ (30 min) 4/Q/A There is currently 3 question and answer. I would like to have 5, what do you think ? Can you find 2 more ? I will then correct/ reformulate them. Remember that the first writing is always kind of bad. "The travel of a thousand miles begins with one step" LaoTsi
4/ (2 hours) Improve the 3/ Humble example, for example:
    4.1 there is no conclusion,
    4.2 repetition of "over and above"
    4.3 1 paragraph but I made some changes => do not forget new lines and ponctuation
    4.4 Think about the rythm => This is the history of a failed research => (fast) 6 eyes, files, points, over, above bla bla and (slower) ignorant, lack of info to discard, the big picture not clear .. (very slow) tomorow
